# LinkedList


# SinglyLinkedList in Java

This project implements a basic Singly Linked List in Java. It provides functionality to add, remove, sort, and reverse elements within the list. The implementation showcases fundamental data structure concepts and is a great starting point for understanding linked lists in Java.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Java installed on your computer. You can check your Java version by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
java -version
```

If Java is not installed, follow the [official Java installation guide](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) to set up Java on your system.

### Downloading

1. **Clone the Repository (Recommended)**

   If you're familiar with Git, you can clone the repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/inquaid/LinkedList.git
   ```

2. **Download ZIP**

   Alternatively, you can download this project as a ZIP file using the GitHub interface.

   - Navigate to the GitHub repository page.
   - Click on the `Code` button, then select `Download ZIP`.

### Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `Node.java` - Defines the node structure for the singly linked list.
- `SinglyLinkedList.java` - Contains the implementation of the singly linked list, including methods to manipulate the list.
- `main.java` - A simple CLI application to demonstrate the usage of the `SinglyLinkedList`.

### Opening the Project

To open and run the project:

1. **Extract the ZIP file** (if downloaded as ZIP) to a directory of your choice.

2. **Open the project in an IDE** (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with the Java extension).

   - **IntelliJ IDEA/Eclipse**: Open the IDE and select `File` > `Open` > Navigate to the project directory > Select the project folder > Click `Open`.

   - **VS Code**: Open VS Code, select `File` > `Open Folder` > Navigate to the project directory > Select the project folder > Click `Open`.

3. **Run the `main.java`** file to start the application. This can typically be done by right-clicking the file in your IDE and selecting `Run 'main.main()'`.

## Usage

The CLI application will prompt you to perform various operations on the singly linked list, such as adding, removing, displaying, sorting, and reversing elements. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the application.
